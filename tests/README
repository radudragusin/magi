Written in Ruby with the Watir-Webdriver system.  

To run all MAGI tests, run from the tests directory:
$ rspec . --format documentation

* Requirements
gem install watir

Running the tests will require watir-webdriver and the chrome webdriver, found here: http://watirwebdriver.com/chrome/.

Functionalities currently tested:
* Describe these tests in more detail
Datasets are currently loaded
Datasets can be uploaded
Google supports login/logout
Tutorial runs
Querying samples and datasets


To add:

* How to write new tests

* Known bugs 

* Design (page objects)

eventual goal: make this ready for UG work
